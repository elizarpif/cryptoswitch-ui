## Grafic shell for the library [cryptoswitch](https://github.com/elizarpif/diploma-elliptic)

A desktop encryption application that I created for my bachelor degree work. This app serves as a graphic shell for the library [cryptoswitch](https://github.com/elizarpif/cryptoswitch) that ensures data safety based on elliptic curves.

## Build

generation .go file from .ui 
```shell script
goqtuic -go-test-file ui/cryptoswitch.ui -go-ui-dir ui/
```
